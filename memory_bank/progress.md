- General UI/UX Refinements (Phase 7).

### Blockers/Issues:
- Need to decide between Rotary wheel or 3D carousel design for the "Browse by First Letter" feature
- Consider how to optimize API call volume for alphabetical browsing

### Notes:
- The application now has a robust, standardized architecture with consistent error handling across all features.

   - Consistent UI for displaying errors with retry options

4. **Mocktail Corner Feature Implementation**
   - Follows the standardized architecture pattern
