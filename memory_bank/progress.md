### Ongoing Tasks:
- None currently - ready to start next feature.

### Next Steps:
- Implement "Mocktail Corner" Feature (Phase 7).
- Implement "Browse by First Letter" Feature (Phase 7).
- General UI/UX Refinements (Phase 7).

### Blockers/Issues:
- Need to finalize the design theme for the "Mocktail Corner" UI ("garden-inspired" theme mentioned in tasks).
- Consider whether to implement bottom navigation bar for better feature navigation.

### Notes:
- The application now has a robust, standardized architecture with consistent error handling across all features.
- All ViewModels should now inherit from BaseViewModel for standardized error handling.
- BaseScreen should be used as foundation for all screens to ensure consistent UI structure.

## Architecture Standardization with BaseViewModel & BaseScreen

Following an architecture review, several key improvements have been made to standardize the application's architecture:

1. **BaseViewModel Enhancement**
   - Updated BaseViewModel with structured Rate Limit error handling
   - Added event processing capabilities through processEvent method
   - Implemented standard UiState pattern across all ViewModels
   - Created common error handling mechanisms for consistent user experience

2. **UI Layer Standardization**
   - Created BaseScreen component as foundation for all screens
   - Implemented RateLimitErrorObserver for centralized error display
   - Standardized loading, error, and content state handling
   - Added consistent UI layout with proper padding and structure

3. **ViewModel Conversion**
   - Converted SearchViewModel to BaseViewModel
   - Converted CocktailDetailViewModel to BaseViewModel
   - Converted FavoritesViewModel to BaseViewModel
   - HomeViewModel was already using BaseViewModel

4. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Implemented centralized error handling in BaseViewModel
   - Created standardized error reporting via Snackbar/Toast
   - Added clear user feedback for API rate limit errors
   - Optimized error recovery mechanisms and retry logic

These enhancements make the application more maintainable, provide a consistent user experience, and establish a strong foundation for future features. The standardized architecture ensures that all features follow the same patterns for state management, error handling, and UI structure.
