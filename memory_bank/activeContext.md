# Active Context

## Current Goal
Continue development of Phase 7 features for the CocktailRecipes application.

## Current Task Focus
Completed implementation and refinement of the Ingredient Explorer feature, including:
- Core functionality and API integration (correcting parsing issues).
- Hexagon grid layout for ingredients.
- Zoom/Explode animation on selection.
- Mind-map style layout (circular, rotatable, limited items) for related cocktails.
- Handling of large lists with a "View All" option.

## Next Task
Begin implementation of the **Advanced Filtering Options** feature (Phase 7).
This involves:
- Creating the filter screen/panel foundation.
- Implementing API calls for category, glass, and alcoholic filters.
- Designing the filter UI.
- Implementing filter logic.

## Key Files / Areas
- `memory_bank/tasks.md` (Tracking progress)
- `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/cocktailrecipes/ui/ingredients/` (Completed feature)
- `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/cocktailrecipes/data/` (API service, Repository, Models - Updated)
- Potentially new `ui/filter` package.
- `app/src/main/java/com/nguyenmoclam/cocktailrecipes/ui/navigation/AppNavigation.kt` (For adding filter screen navigation)

## Recent Changes / Context
- Corrected API parsing for ingredient list.
- Added zoom/explode animation to ingredient selection.
- Implemented and refined a circular mind-map layout for related cocktails.
- Introduced state management for showing limited vs. all related cocktails.
- Added rotation gesture to the mind-map layout.
- Removed redundant Favorites button from Home screen TopAppBar.

## Blockers/Questions
- Need to finalize the design theme for the filter UI ("mixology lab" theme mentioned in tasks).
- Investigate persistent linter errors in test files (JUnit/Mockito references).

## Project Architecture Reminders
- MVVM with Clean Architecture.
- Jetpack Compose for UI.
- Hilt for DI.
- Retrofit/OkHttp for Networking.
- Room for Local DB (Favorites).
- Coroutines/Flow for async.
- Repository pattern.

  - Implementing exponential backoff for rate limit responses (0.5h)
  - Adding user-facing feedback when rate limits are reached (0.5h)
  - Storing and respecting rate limit headers from API responses (0.5h)
- Begin implementing Ingredient Explorer Feature 
  - Create Ingredient Explorer screen foundation (1h)

  - https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i={ingredient} - Filter by ingredient
  - https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Cocktail - Get popular cocktails
  - https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php - Get random cocktail
  - https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/list.php?i=list - Get all ingredients
  - https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/list.php?c=list - Get all categories
  - https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/list.php?g=list - Get all glass types

- Home screen implementation is complete with pull-to-refresh functionality ✅
- Detail screen implementation is complete ✅
- Search functionality with history and filtering by ingredient is complete ✅
- Favorites feature with Room database integration is complete ✅
- Loading states, error handling, and offline capabilities in the UI are complete ✅
- Unit tests for repository, viewmodel, and mappers are complete ✅
- UI testing for all main user flows and accessibility compliance is complete ✅

- API performance tracking and dashboard have been implemented ✅
- Fixed database operations to run properly on background threads using Dispatchers.IO ✅
- "Surprise Me!" Random Cocktail Feature has been implemented with shake gesture and animations ✅
- New features planned for Phase 7 (remaining):
  - Ingredient Explorer with detailed ingredient views (Next to implement)
  - Advanced Filtering Options (by category, glass type, alcoholic/non-alcoholic)
  - "Mocktail Corner" dedicated section for non-alcoholic drinks
  - "Browse by First Letter" alphabetical navigation
- Current focus is completing rate limiting protection and beginning implementation of Ingredient Explorer feature

  - This applies to Room database queries, updates, inserts, deletes
  - Also needed for DataStore preferences editing operations for consistency
- Fixed an issue with the RandomCocktailCard favorite toggle functionality - the code wasn't finding the cocktail in the main list. Fixed by updating the toggleFavorite method to also check the randomCocktail property.
