# Active Context

## Current Goal
Continue development of Phase 7 features for the CocktailRecipes application and improve core architecture.

## Current Task Focus
Completed implementation of Rate Limit Error Handling and BaseViewModel standardization, including:
- Updated BaseViewModel with Rate Limit error handling
- Created RateLimitErrorObserver component for error display
- Integrated BaseScreen as foundation for all screens
- Converted all ViewModels to inherit from BaseViewModel

## Next Task
Begin implementation of the **"Mocktail Corner" Feature** (Phase 7).
This involves:
- Adding dedicated section for non-alcoholic drinks
- Implementing API integration with filter.php?a=Non_Alcoholic
- Designing "garden-inspired" UI theme
- Adding special visual effects and animations

- Jetpack Compose for UI.
- Hilt for DI.
- Retrofit/OkHttp for Networking.
- Room for Local DB (Favorites).
- Coroutines/Flow for async.
- Repository pattern.
