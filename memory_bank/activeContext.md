  - https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i={ingredient} - Filter by ingredient
  - https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Cocktail - Get popular cocktails
  - https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php - Get random cocktail
- Home screen implementation is complete with pull-to-refresh functionality ✅
- Detail screen implementation is complete ✅
- Search functionality with history and filtering by ingredient is complete ✅
- Favorites feature with Room database integration is complete ✅
- Loading states, error handling, and offline capabilities in the UI are complete ✅
- Unit tests for repository, viewmodel, and mappers are complete ✅
